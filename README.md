## Analog Clock Program in Pascal

This Pascal program creates an analog clock with graphical display, showing hour, minute, and second hands, along with a digital time readout. It provides a simple yet effective demonstration of graphical programming in Pascal, utilizing functions and procedures to draw clock elements dynamically on the screen.

**Features:**

1. Graphical display of an analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands.
2. Digital time readout showing hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
3. Dynamic adaptation to different screen orientations (portrait or landscape).
4. Simple user interaction: the clock display updates continuously until a key is pressed.

**How to Use:**

1. Compile the Pascal program using a Pascal compiler such as Free Pascal Compiler (FPC).
2. Execute the compiled program to launch the analog clock display.
3. The clock will continuously update to reflect the current time until a key is pressed.
4. Exit the program by pressing any key.

**Dependencies:**

This program relies on the Graph unit for graphical operations, which is typically available in Pascal compilers like Free Pascal.
